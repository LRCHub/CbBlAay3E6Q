Beams of light up in the sky
Malfunctioned machinery, lost in time
Don't understand, I'm wondering why
How can this happen, it's so out of line

Strangers among us from the outer strars
Whatever you know, keep your silence
Unearthly ones from galaxies afar
There will be violence.

Chorus 1:
They know something that we don't know
What cannot be seen they'll never show
Hangar 18, Area 51
Hangar 18 ...

For me to recall, they hypnotize
It's all part of investigations
They say that I just fantasize
Just try to explain mutilations.

Chorus 2:
They know something that we don't know
What cannot be seen they'll never show
Hangar 18, Area 51
Hangar 18 ...
We're victims of grand illusion
Now we're lost in mass confusion

Hangar 18, Area 51
Hangar 18...

Hangar 18...
